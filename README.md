GettingAndCleaningData
======================

## Information
This repository contains an r-script, run_analysis.R. The script tidies up a dataset from Samsung smartphones,
containing accelerometer data. The script returns a table in a .txt file, tidy_data.txt (also included in this repository)
that contains average values of mean and standarddeviation data from all subjects and all activities.

## Requirements for the script
The script analyses a dataset from Samsung smartphones, and as such it is required that the dataset is present in your
working directory. 
The dataset can be found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
More information on the dataset can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

## Codebook
A codebook is included in this repository. The codebook explains all the variables in the final tidy dataset, as well as
the individual steps used to obtain the tidy dataset.
